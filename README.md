# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eduardo De Luca!
- I'm currently working as a Data Enginner, but I'm interested on data projects in general.
- Member of Codecademy community
- My experience is most related to e-commerce, where I applied most of what I learnt about data and programming, using tools like Python, Pyspark, SQL, OAuth 2.0 and AWS, while I'm studying and deepening my knowledge on several other tools and frameworks!
- Several of the scripts I developed were intended for single use on cleaning and transforming very specific data. Now I'm developing some libs based on patterns that I identified on my daily basis, as well as keeping track of bigger projects and scripts, either for continuos or single use, documenting everything through GitHub.
